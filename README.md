# Earthquake Damage Prediction

## Project Overview

This project predicts the extent of damage caused by earthquakes using machine learning algorithms. It leverages historical earthquake data to analyze various factors like magnitude, depth, and location, and their correlation with the resulting damage.

The project makes use of:
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and analysis
- **Numpy** for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualizing data and patterns
- **Scikit-learn** for implementing machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)

Setup and Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TejasWaghmare18/Earthquake-Damage-Prediction.git
```
Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you're using Jupyter notebooks, install Jupyter:
```bash
pip install jupyter
```
Usage
Running the Jupyter Notebook
Navigate to the notebooks folder and start Jupyter:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Open Earthquake_Damage_Prediction.ipynb or Earthquake_Damage_Prediction_copy.ipynb and run through the cells to explore the data, visualizations, and model training process.

Running the Model Script
To run the prediction model script directly, execute:
```bash
python src/prediction_model.py
```
This will train the model on the data and output predictions based on the features.

Dependencies
The following Python packages are required to run the project:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

You can install them by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
